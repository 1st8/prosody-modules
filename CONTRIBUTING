Guidelines for developers
-------------------------

* Each module should be contained in a folder of its name (e.g. 
  `mod_ping/mod_ping.lua`)
* Each module should have a wiki page with a description, 
  usage, configuration and todo sections (feel free to copy an 
  existing one as a template)
* Commit messages should begin with the name of the plugin they 
  are for (e.g. `mod_ping: Set correct namespace on pongs`) 

Instructions on cloning the repository are at 
http://code.google.com/p/prosody-modules/source/checkout - if you have 
commit access you will also see a link on that page to view your Google 
Code password (not the same as your Google account password) to push your 
changes.
